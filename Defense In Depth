Defense In Depth is a strategy that utilizes multiple layers of security to protect your assets.

Depending on the secure policy framework you choose, that will determine what assets have what types of securities associated with them. What determins the 
Secure Policy Framework is based on the consequences of what happens if your high value assets get compromised. 

To approach it another way, you are trying to secure your environment to prevent a worst case senario from happening to your organization. 
You are building your security according the concept of how severe consequences are if an asset is comrpomise. 

An asset is considered a users credentials, on prem nodes (servers, computers, Cell Phone, printers, scanners, badge systems, routers/AC points, Smart Devices, and more)

Defense In Depth's principal is, What you cannot prevent needs to be detected; If it cannot be detected you will need to be able to recovery from it. 
A new theme that is making it's way to the scene is Resiliency. 
Resilient organizations continually keep critical functions running by adapting to changes and risks that would otherwise shut them down. 

Resiliency: 
Multiple ISPs, redundant infrasturucre of on prem servers (Clusters), Load Balencers, Backup generators, UPSs, Cellular and Network Bonding Technology. 

Preventative: 
MFA enabled, DLP Mail Hygene enabled, Deploy IPS, conditional access policies in place, DNS Security, Firewall, disable network
drops when not in use, hire a security guard, put up security camera....

Detection: 
Setup a SEIM to log events, Setup an IDS, Setup a NIDS, setup Canarytokens. You can't stop 100% of all attacks but you better make sure they are logged. 

Recover: 
An effective Recovery Program includes Risk Management, contingency and continuity planning, and other security and emergency management frameworks and policies. 
  The following plans make up the NIST Cyber Security Policy Framework: NIST SP 800-34 Rev 1 "Contingency Planning Guide for Federal Information Systems"
