Defense In Depth is a strategy that utilizes multiple layers of security to protect the bottom line. Most articles you come across will say "to protect the asset"
I 100% believe that is fully incorrect, the moment an asset is compromised it's no longer protected therefore your "bottom line" is what gets hit as a reproccution of the
asset being compromis. 

The bottom line is your companies ability to earn income.  

Depending on the secure policy framework you choose, that will determine what layers of your org have protection. What determins the Secure Policy Framework is based on
the consequences of what happens if your high value assets get compromised. 

To approach it another way, you are trying to secure your environment to prevent a worst case senario from happening to your organization. 
You are building your security according the concept of how severe consequences are if an asset is comrpomise. 

An asset is considered a users credentials, on prem nodes (servers, computers, Cell Phone, printers, scanners, badge systems, routers/AC points, Smart Devices, and more)

Your layers of security might be 

Preventative: 
MFA enabled, DLP Mail Hygene enabled, Deploy IPS, conditional access policies in place, DNS Security, Firewall, redundant ISP's, Load Balencers, disable network
drops when not in use, hire a security guard, put up security camera....

Detection: 
Setup a SEIM to log events, Setup an IDS, Setup a NIDS

Recover: 
An effective Recovery Program includes Risk Management, contingency and continuity planning, and other security and emergency management frameworks and policies.
