  Conventional Access Control Approachs employ static information system accounts and predefined sets of user privileges. 
    Examples:
    Adding a user to a security group 

  Dynamic Access Control Approaches rely on run time access control decisions facilitated by dynamic privilege management. 
    Examples: 
    PIM (Privileged Identity Manager)
    Azure Role-Based Access Control (Azure RBAC)
    Conditional Access Policies > Regional/Zone Filtering 
      Note: Dynamic Privilege Management can support requirements for a resilient environment when discussing your Defence in Depth.
